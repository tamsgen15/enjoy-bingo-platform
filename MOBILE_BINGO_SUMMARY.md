# Mobile Bingo Cards APK - Project Summary

## Overview

Created a simple Android APK app that allows bingo players to use their phones instead of physical printed cards. The app provides the same 100 bingo cards as your `printable_cards` folder and database.

## Key Features

### For Players
- **Card Selection**: Choose 1-4 cards from 100 available options
- **Interactive Marking**: Tap numbers to mark/unmark as they're called
- **Offline Play**: Works without internet connection during games
- **Auto-Save**: Automatically saves selected cards and marked numbers
- **Compact Layout**: 2-column responsive design (140x190px equivalent)
- **BINGO Button**: Easy "CALL BINGO!" button for claiming prizes

### For Admin/Tenant
- **Same Card Data**: Uses identical cards as your printable_cards (1-100)
- **No System Changes**: Works alongside existing platform without modifications
- **Manual Verification**: Players still shout "BINGO!" and provide card numbers
- **Easy Distribution**: Single APK file to share with players

## How It Works

1. **Player selects cards** (1-4) from the mobile app
2. **Player tells admin** their preferred card numbers
3. **Admin assigns same cards** in the existing platform system
4. **Player plays with mobile app** while admin runs game normally
5. **Player marks numbers** on phone as they're called
6. **Player calls "BINGO!"** manually and provides card numbers for verification
7. **Admin verifies** using existing system (same as physical cards)

## Next Steps

1. **Build APK**: Run `build-apk.bat` in the mobile-bingo-app folder
2. **Test**: Install APK on a test device to verify functionality
3. **Distribute**: Share APK file with players via WhatsApp/email
4. **Instruct Players**: Provide INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md to players
5. **Play**: Use alongside existing platform - no changes needed

## Technical Requirements

### For Building APK
- Node.js 16+
- Android Studio
- Java JDK 11+

### For Players
- Android 5.0+ (API level 21+)

## Support

The mobile app works independently of your main platform. Players can use either physical cards OR mobile cards - both use the same verification system through your existing admin interface.
