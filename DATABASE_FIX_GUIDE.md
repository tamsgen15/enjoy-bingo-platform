# Database Error Fix Guide

## Problem
Your bingo app is showing continuous 400 and 404 errors because:
1. Database tables are missing or incorrectly configured
2. The `bingo_patterns` table doesn't exist (404 errors)
3. Row Level Security policies are blocking access (400 errors)
4. The app is stuck in an infinite polling loop

## Quick Fix

### Step 1: Run the Database Setup Script
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/fix_database_errors.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the script

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created
After running the script, you should have these tables:
- `games`
- `players` 
- `called_numbers`
- `bingo_cards`
- `bingo_patterns` (this was missing!)
- `game_rules`
- `player_cards`
- `admin_users`

### Step 3: Check Your Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env.local` file has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### Step 4: Restart Your Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What the Fix Does

1. **Creates Missing Tables**: Adds the `bingo_patterns` table and ensures all other tables exist
2. **Sets Up Proper Permissions**: Creates RLS policies that allow all operations
3. **Generates Sample Data**: Creates 100 bingo cards and default game patterns
4. **Enables Realtime**: Sets up real-time subscriptions for live updates
5. **Adds Error Handling**: Prevents infinite polling loops when errors occur

## Alternative: Use the Fixed Context

If you want better error handling, replace your current RealtimeGameContext with:
```typescript
// In your layout.tsx or main component
import { RealtimeGameProvider } from '@/lib/RealtimeGameContextFixed'
```

## Verification

Add the DatabaseStatus component to your main page to monitor connection:
```typescript
import { DatabaseStatus } from '@/components/DatabaseStatus'

// In your component
<DatabaseStatus />
```

## Still Having Issues?

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify your Supabase project is active and not paused
3. Ensure your API keys are correct and have proper permissions
4. Try creating a new Supabase project if the current one is corrupted

## Prevention

To avoid this in the future:
- Always run database migrations in a staging environment first
- Use proper error handling in your API calls
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitor your database connection status
